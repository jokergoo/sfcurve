\usage{
\S4method{sfc_expand}{sfc_hilbert}(p, code)

\S4method{sfc_expand}{sfc_peano}(p, code = 1)

\S4method{sfc_expand}{sfc_meander}(p, code)

\S4method{sfc_expand}{sfc_rules}(p, letters, code = 1L, flip = FALSE, by = "Cpp")
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{An \code{sfc_rules} object.}

\item{code}{The transverse code.}

\item{letters}{A list patterns, must be a factor.}

\item{flip}{For the Peano curve and the Meander curves, each unit can flip without affecting other parts in the curve. This argument
controls whether to flip the unit. Since currently it only works on the Peano curve and the Meander curve, \code{flip} should be a logical
vector of length one or length of 9. Whether it flips horizontally, vertically or against the diagonal line is automatically choosen.}

\item{by}{Which implemnetation, only for the testing purpose.}
}
\value{
In the same class as the input object. \code{sfc_expand()} on the \code{sfc_rules} objects returns an \code{sfc_sequence} object.
}
\description{
Expand the curve to the next level
}
\details{
For the Hilbert curve and Meander curve, as long as the transverse code of the first base pattern in the sequence is determinted,
the transverse codes for other base patterns in the sequence are all determined. For the Peano curve, \code{code} is always 1.

These functions are mainly used internally.
