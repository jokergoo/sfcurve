Description: Implementation of all possible forms of 2x2 and 3x3 space-filling curves, 
    i.e., the generalized forms of the Hilbert curve <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve>, 
    the Peano curve <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve> and the Peano curve in the 
    meander type (Figure 5 in <https://eudml.org/doc/141086>). It can generates nxn curves expanded from
    any specific level-1 units. It also implements the H-curve and the three-dimensional Hilbert curve.
