We consider the type of space-filling curve that has a 2x2 rate. The growth of the curve
can be described in a top-bottom manner, where within a square with fixed size (normally a unit square), the square
is partitioned into four sub-square by equally splitting it into two halves both horizontally and vertically. Then on each subsquare,
such partitioning is applied recursively. It can also be described in a bottom-top manner, where with a unit square expands into 
four squares by 2 folds both on rows and columns, then for each of the four square, it expands recursively. It is easy to see,
the two ways are identically only with a size factor $n$ (the edge of the square) or $n^2$ (the area).

For easy discussion, we use the expansion mode. When expanding one square to four squares (2x2), there are several ways, such as the z-curve or H-curve.
Here we require the curve only goes straight, left or right along the four squares without interuptted or crossed. 

The following three plots demonstrate the three steps of the expansion which are $2^0 \times 2^0$ (level 0), 
$2^1 \times 2^1$ (level 1) and $2^2 \times 2^2$ (level 2).

## Base patterns

The space-filling curve can be generated by recursively repeating certain patterns on its sub-structures. Thus, we define 
the following expansion rules from level 0 to level 1. The patterns on level 0 are called the **base patterns** which contains a single points
and its in-direction and out-direction. 


```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.5}
draw_rules_hilbert()
```

For example, base pattern $I$ is on level 0, explicitly denoted as $I^{(0)}$, when it 
expands to level 1 while keeping the direction of the curve, there are two options as listed in the diagram. 
As an example here, we choose the first option. Now for the following expansion:

$$
I^{(0)} \rightarrow I^{(1)}_1
$$

```{r, fig.width = 1.3, fig.height = 1.3, echo = FALSE}
grid.newpage()
pushViewport(viewport(xscale = c(-1.5, 1.5), yscale = c(-1.5, 1.5), width = unit(4, "cm"), height = unit(4, "cm")))
grid.points(c(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5), c(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5), default.units = "native", pch = 16, size = unit(4, "pt"))
grid.lines(c(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5), c(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5), default.units = "native", gp = gpar(col = "black"))
grid.lines(c(-0.5, -0.5, 0)-0.1, c(-1, -0.5, -0.5)+0.1, default.units = "native", gp = gpar(col = 2), arrow = arrow(angle = 15, length = unit(6, "pt")))
grid.lines(c(0, 0.5, 0.5)+0.1, c(-0.5, -0.5, 0)-0.1, default.units = "native", gp = gpar(col = 3), arrow = arrow(angle = 15, length = unit(6, "pt")))
grid.lines(c(0.5, 0.5, 0)+0.1, c(0, 0.5, 0.5)+0.1, default.units = "native", gp = gpar(col = 4), arrow = arrow(angle = 15, length = unit(6, "pt")))
grid.lines(c(0, -0.5, -0.5)-0.1, c(0.5, 0.5, 1)-0.1, default.units = "native", gp = gpar(col = 5), arrow = arrow(angle = 15, length = unit(6, "pt")))
popViewport()
```

we can describe the curve generation in four steps:

- step 1. bottom in, right out. This is the base pattern $R$ without rotation, thus we denote it as $R^{(0)}$,
- step 2. left in, top out. This is the base pattern $L$ with -90 degrees clockwise rotation, thus we denote it as $L^{(0),-90}$ or $L^{(0),270}$,
- step 3. bottom in, left out. This is the base pattern $L$ without rotation, and we denote it as $L^{(0)}$,
- step 4. right in, top out. This step can be denoted as $R^{(0),90}$.

Then the expansion can be written as a sequence:

$$
I^{(1)}_1 = R^{(0)}L^{(0),90}L^{(0)}R^{(0),270}
$$

With konwing the in-direction and out-direction of base patterns, the shape of $I^{(1)}_1$ can be determined.

In the diagram, the notation of levels are removed since it can be easily identified.

There are several criterions when building the rules:

1. The in-direction and out-direction should be unchanged in level 0 and level 1.
2. Only rotation is allowed. Flipping is not allowed.

## Rotate

We set the rotation of all base patterns with the shapes listed in the diagram to zero (of course it is only for convinience).
We can easily define the rotations of a base pattern or a sequence of base patterns.

Denote $X$ as a base pattern, $X \in \{I, R, L, U, C, B, D, P, Q\}$,
and $X^\theta$ where $\theta$ is the rotation regarding to the base state in the diagram,
$\theta \in \{0, 90, 180, 270\}$ and a positive $\theta$ corresponds to 
reverse clockwise rotation, we have 

$$ (X^{\theta_1})^{\theta_2} = X^{\theta_1 + \theta_2} $$

which means rotating the pattern twice is identical to rotating the pattern once but
with the sum of the two rotations.

Note

$$
X^\theta = X^{\theta \bmod 360}
$$

Rotating a sequence of base patterns is identical to a sequence of rotated base patterns.

$$
(X_1^{\theta_1}X_2^{\theta_2}...X_n^{\theta_n})^\theta  = X_1^{(\theta_1 + \theta)}X_2^{(\theta_2 + \theta)} ... X_n^{(\theta_n + \theta)}
$$

By also including all four rotations of the base patterns, the diagram contains the complete set of expansions from level 0 to level 1
for the 2x2 curve.


## Expand the curve

The diagram only defines the expansion of the curve from level 0 to level 1 (the 0-to-1 expansion), but that is already
enough for generating a curve to level k. For simplicity, we take a curve initialized by a single base pattern as an example.
The expansion process can be described as the following steps:

1. level 0 -> level 1, $P_1 = (X_i)_4$. This generates a level 1 curve with 4 base patterns.
2. level 1 -> level 2, $P_2 = (X_i)_{16}$. For each base pattern in $P_1$, we replace it with its level 1 expansion. This
   generates a curve with $4^2$ base patterns.
3. level k-1 -> level k, $P_k = (X_i)_{4^k}$. For each base pattern in $P_{k-1}$, we replace it with its level 1 expansion. This
   generates a curve with $4^k$ base patterns.

As described before, for a sequence of $n$ base patterns, its structure is determined.

As shown in the diagram, in the expansion from level 0 to level 1, each base pattern has two options to choose, thus we need
a criterion to select the proper one to make sure all the points are correctedly connected on the final curve.

The key step is step two when the curve is expanded from level 1 to level 2. Let's rewrite $P_1$ as a sequence of four base patterns:

$$
P_1 = X_1 X_2 X_3 X_4
$$

When e.g. the base pattern $X_1$ expands to level 1 denoted as $X^{(1)}_{1,<i>}$ ($i=1$ or $i=2$), then $P_2$ is:

$$
P_2 = X^{(1)}_{1,<i_1>} X^{(1)}_{2,<i_2>} X^{(1)}_{3,<i_3>} X^{(1)}_{4,<i_4>}
$$

The four $X^{(1)}_{1,<i>}$ represents as four 2x2 grids. We need a criterion for selecting $i$ for each level 1 unit to make
sure all the level 1 units on the curve are properly connected.

Since a curve on level k can also be represented as a sequence of level 1 units. By applying the successful method, we can
have a correctedly formatted curve.


### Corners

All the level 1 units transverse through a $2 \times 2$ grids, thus they all have a
square-shape with an in-direction and an out-direction. Denote the bottom
left and top right have a value of 1 and the top left and bottom right
have a value of 2.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 2, fig.height = 2}
pushViewport(viewport(xscale = c(-1.5, 1.5), yscale = c(-1.5, 1.5)))
grid.segments(c(-1, -1, -1), c(-1, 0, 1), c(1, 1, 1), c(-1, 0, 1), default.units = "native", gp = gpar(col = "grey", lty = 3))
grid.segments(c(-1, 0, 1), c(-1, -1, -1), c(-1, 0, 1), c(1, 1, 1), default.units = "native", gp = gpar(col = "grey", lty = 3))
grid.lines(c(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1), c(-1, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5), default.units = "native", arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "native"), angle = 15), gp = gpar(col = "grey"))
grid.lines(c(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5), c(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5), default.units = "native", gp = gpar(lwd = 2, col = "black"))
grid.points(c(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5), c(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5), default.units = "native", pch = 16, size = unit(4, "pt"))
grid.text(c(1, 1, 2, 2), c(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5), c(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5), default.units = "native", gp = gpar(col = "grey"),
	hjust = c(2, -1, -1, 2), vjust = c(2, -1, 2, -1))
popViewport()
```


We define the **corner value** $\tau$ of the level 1 unit $X^{(1)}$ as a
2-tuple $(c_1, c_2)$ where $c_1$ is the value of the entering corner
and $c_2$ is the value of the leaving corner of $X^{(1)}$:

$$
\tau_{X^{(1)}} = (c_1, c_2), \quad c_1, c_2 \in \{1, 2\}
$$

In the diagram, for the 2x2 unit, $\tau_{X^{(1)}} = (1, 2)$ or $\tau_{X^{(1)}} = (2, 1)$, so we define the complement of $c$ as

$$
\hat{c} = \left\{\begin{matrix}
2 & \text{if }c = 1,\\ 
1 & \text{if }c = 2,\\ 
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

Rotating $X^{(1)}$  by 90 degrees (or its multiples) (either clockwise or reverse clockwise) changes the order of the two
values in the tuple, while rotating by 180 degrees (or its multiples) does not.

$$
\begin{align*}
\tau_{X^{(1), 90k}} &= (c_1, c_2), & \text{if }k\text{ is even}, \\
\tau_{X^{(1), 90k}} &= (\hat{c}_1, \hat{c}_2), & \text{if }k\text{ is odd}, \\
\tau_{X^{(1), 180k}} &= (c_1, c_2) \\
\end{align*}
$$


Let's go back to the diagram. For each base pattern, there are two level 1 units
that can be expanded to. We code
the two level 1 units according to their corner values as follows for convinience:

$$
\begin{align*}
X_{<1>}^{(1)} \quad \text{if }\tau_{X^{(1)}} &= (1, 2), \\
X_{<2>}^{(1)} \quad \text{if }\tau_{X^{(1)}} &= (2, 1). \\
\end{align*}
$$


### Connect patterns


For two level-1 units $X^{(1)}$ and $Y^{(1)}$ with corners $(c_1, c_2)$ and $(c_3, c_4)$ (of course $c_2 = \hat{c_1}$, $c_4 = \hat{c_3}$), 
to construct the sequence $XY$, we need to ensure the two curves are connectable.
Since the two curves represented as two square patterns
can only be connected horizontally or vertically, it should fit $c_2 = \hat{c_3}$,
i.e. with the forms of $\tau_{X^{(1)}} = (1, 2), \tau_{y^{(1)}} = (1,2)$ or $\tau_{X^{(1)}} = (2, 1), \tau_{y^{(1)}} = (2,1)$.
It is easy to see, we can apply to a sequence with any length.

Next Let's extend it to rotations. Denote two level-1 curves $X^{(1),\alpha} Y^{(1),\beta}$, 
we first assign an expansion code $i$ to the first curve, say $X_{<i>}^{(1),\alpha}$ ($i \in \{1,2\}$), and we define the complement expansion code $j$ as:


$$
j = \left\{\begin{matrix}
1 & \text{if }i = 2,\\ 
2 & \text{if }i = 1.\\ 
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

then the expansion code for $Y^{(1),\beta}$ is determined by $k = (\beta - \alpha)/90$:

$$
\left\{\begin{matrix}
Y^{(1),\beta}_{<i>}, & \text{if }k\text{ is even}, \\
Y^{(1),\beta}_{<j>}, & \text{if }k\text{ is odd}. \\
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

which means if $\beta-\alpha$ is the even multiple of $90^\circ$, $Y^{(1),\beta}$ has the same expansion code as $X^{(1),\alpha}$, or $90^\circ$, $Y^{(1),\beta}$
has the complement code of $X^{(1),\alpha}$.

so for example, starting from $I^{90}$, to extend it, we choose $I_1^{90}$ with the level 1 form

$$
P_1 = I_1^{90} = (RL^{90}LR^{270})^{90} = R^{90}L^{180}L^{90}R
$$

To extend to level 2, we have to assign the expansion code to each of the $RLRL$ to extend, we start from the first pattern $R$, as there are two options, we use $R_1$ (here we write $R_{<1>}$ as $R_1$ for simplicity), then according to the rules

$$
P_2 = R_1^{90}L_2^{180}L_1^{90}R_2
$$
then by extending to level 0, we can obtain the final sequence of base patterns for a level 2 curve:

$$
\begin{align*}
P_2 &= (IRR^{90}L^{180})^{90}(ILL^{270}R^{180})^{180}(RL^{90}LI^{270})^{90}(LR^{270}RI^{90}) \\
    &= I^{90}R^{90}R^{180}L^{270}I^{180}L^{180}L^{90}RR^{90}L^{180}L^{90}ILR^{270}RI^{90} \\
\end{align*}
$$

In the sequence of the base patterns, the final structure is only determined by the first base pattern.
For the remaining base patterns, only the "action" is necesarry while the in-direction and out-direction is not of use.
They are all fixed by the fist base pattern. Then we can write $P_2$ as:

$$
I^{90}|srrlsllrrllslrrl
$$

In the direction of approaching, wiht the initial state $I^90$ which means horizontally from left to right,
th esequence is

- $s$ go straight
- $r$ turn right
- $l$ turn left

When expanding a curve from level k-1 to level k, on level k-1, we only need to pre-select the transverse code for the
first base pattern, then the transverse code for the remainingbase patterns on level k-1 is determined, which ensures
the expanded $4^{k-1}$ 2x2 units are all connected.


Finally, the sequence of the transverse code for each base unit in the expansion is called the **transverse path**. E.g. 
the transverse path of $P_1$ 

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2.5}
plot_transverse_paths(SFC_RULES_HILBERT, SFC_RULES_HILBERT@rules$I[[1]])
```

## Encode the curve

Let's start from a single base pattern as the intiali pattern. To recursively expand
the curve, since each base pattern has two types of xxx, thus, on easy step, we need
to choose the expanded pattern s...

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("hc_expand.png")
```

as shown, on each step, xxx, thus on a level $k$, the total number of 
curves are $2^k$. Taking $R$ as the initial patter and on level 3, the
total set of curves are 8:

Note the oritentation of $R$, bottom in and right out.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
draw_multiple_curves(
	sfc_hilbert("R", code = "111"),
	sfc_hilbert("R", code = "112"),
	sfc_hilbert("R", code = "121"),
	sfc_hilbert("R", code = "122"),
	sfc_hilbert("R", code = "211"),
	sfc_hilbert("R", code = "212"),
	sfc_hilbert("R", code = "221"),
	sfc_hilbert("R", code = "222"),
	nrow = 2)
```


Then, with knowing the intial patter and the tye of each step, the 
curve is fixed. Then we can describe a $2^k \times 2^k$ curve
denoted as $\mathcal{C}_k$

$$
\mathcal{C}_k := X^{(0)}|\pi_1 \pi_2 ... \pi_k, \pi_i \in \{1, 2\}
$$


note the sequence $(\pi_1 \pi_2, ..., \pi_k)$ can be represented as 
a sequence of binary bits, it can be xxx into an integer

$$
X|111 = X|0_3 \\
X|121 = X|2_3 \\
X|222 = X|7_3
$$


A specific base pattern can induce $2^k$ differnet forms of curves on level $k$, so the total number of the forms for all 9 base patterns
with 4 rotations are

$$
4 \times 9 \times 2^k = 36 \times 2^k
$$


### Specific forms

We can generate the Hilbert curve, Moore curve and $\beta\Omega$  curve as follows:


```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2}
p1 = sfc_hilbert("I", code =  "111", rot = -90)
p2 = sfc_hilbert("U", code =  "211", rot = 180)
p3 = sfc_hilbert("C", code = "2121", rot = -90)

draw_multiple_curves(p1, p2, p3)
```

In the sequence of type code on levels:

$$
\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_{k-1}, \pi_{k}
$$

The type code on the left of the sequence correspond to the higher level organization of the folding, and codes
on the right side correspond to the lower level. Particularlly, the last two type codes which construct the unit of 4x4
is the most observable unit in the curve. If we define the following shape as the basic unit of Hilbert curve

```{r, fig.width = 2, fig.height = 2}
plot(sfc_hilbert("R", "11"), extend = FALSE)
```

we can have the following curve with the Hilbert unit

$$
\mathcal{H}_k := X^{\theta}|\pi_1 \pi_2 ... \pi_{k_-1} \pi_k) \qand \text{where }\pi_{k-1} = \pi_k, \theta \in \{0, 90, 180, 270\}
$$

on level 2, only $\{I, R, L, U\}$.


We can also define the $\beta$ unit and the $\Omega$ unit as the following two

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2}
draw_multiple_curves(
	sfc_hilbert("L", "21"),
	sfc_hilbert("I", "12", rot = -90)
)
```


genral $\beta\Omega$ curve (k >= 3)

$$
\mathcal{B}_k := X^{\theta}(\pi_1 \pi_2 ... \pi_{k_-1}, \pi_k) \quad \text{where }\pi_{k-1} \ne \pi_k, \theta \in \{0, 90, 180, 270\}
$$

### Combinations

Let's go back to the sequence of a curve on level k

$$
\mathcal{C}_k = X^{(0)}|\pi_1 \pi_2 ... \pi_k, \pi_i \in \{1, 2\}
$$

The equation represents the curve starts from $X^{(0)}$ and expands k xxx. We can merge $X^{(0)}$ and the first expansion as the initial pattern,
and xx k-1 times, written as:

$$
\mathcal{C}_k = (X^{(0)}|\pi_1) | \pi_2 ... \pi_k, \pi_i \in \{1, 2\}
$$

Similarll we can have move any $\pi_i$ to the left side of $|$:

$$
\mathcal{C}_k = (X^{(0)}|\pi_1 ... \pi_i) | \pi_{(i+1)} ... \pi_k
$$

or we can write in a pattern, extend 1, a new pattern ,,...

$$
\mathcal{C}_k = {[(X^{(0)}|\pi_1)| \pi_2] | ...}| \pi_k
$$

or

$$
\mathcal{C}_k = X^{(0)}|\pi_1 | \pi_2 | ... | \pi_k
$$

```{r, fig.width= 12, fig.height = 2.5}
initial = sfc_seed("R")
draw_multiple_curves(
	sfc_hilbert(initial, "1212"),
	sfc_hilbert(sfc_hilbert(initial, "1"), "212"),
	sfc_hilbert(sfc_hilbert(initial, "12"), "12"),
	sfc_hilbert(sfc_hilbert(initial, "121"), "2"),
	sfc_hilbert(sfc_hilbert(initial, "1212"), NULL),
	sfc_hilbert(sfc_hilbert(sfc_hilbert(sfc_hilbert(initial, "1"), "2"), "1"), "2"),
    nrow = 1
)
```

we can also merge neighbouring xxx , e.g.

$$
\mathcal{C}_k = X^{(0)}| (\pi_1 \pi_2) | (\pi_3 \pi_4) | ... | (\pi_{k-1} \pi_k
$$

This means, instead of doing a 2x2 expansion, now we do a 4x4 expansion, and each expansion mode
is determined by $\pi_{i-1} \pi_i$

$$
\begin{align*}
\lambda &= \pi \pi' \\
\lambda &= \left\{\begin{matrix}
& 1, \pi \pi' = 1 1 \\
& 2, \pi \pi' = 1 2 \\
& 3, \pi \pi' = 2 1 \\
& 4, \pi \pi' = 2 2 \\
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{align*}
$$

$$
X|\lambda_1 \lambda_2 ... = X|\pi_1\pi_1' \pi_2 \pi_2' ...
$$

```{r}
initial = sfc_hilbert("R")
sfc_4x4 = function(initial, code) {
	map = c("1" = "11", "2" = "12", "3" = "21", "4" = "22")
	code = strsplit(code, "")[[1]]
	code2 = paste(map[code], collapse = "")
	sfc_hilbert(initial, code2)
}
draw_multiple_curves(
	initial,
	sfc_4x4(initial, "1"),
	sfc_4x4(initial, "3"),
	sfc_4x4(initial, "11"),
	sfc_4x4(initial, "13")
)
```

In some xxx, instead of using single point as the base pattern, some xx use the patterns on level 1, i.e. 2x2 pattern as the base pattern

$$
\mathcal{C}_k = X^{(0)}| (\pi_1))| \pi_2 ... \pi_{k-1} \pi_k
$$

```{r}
initial = sfc_hilbert("R", 1)
draw_multiple_curves(
	initial,
	sfc_hilbert(initial, "1"),
	sfc_hilbert(initial, "11")
)
```


## Seed as a sequence

In the previous curve defintion, X is xx as a single base pattern. There is no restriction ofxx X can be a list of sequence with valid struture.

In the following, the global structure is $I^{90}RL$, horizonal staring from left, go straight, then turn right and turn left

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
p = sfc_hilbert("IRL", code = c(1, 1, 1, 1), rot = 90)
plot(p)
```

```{r, fig.width = 2, fig.height = 2}
p = sfc_seed("LLLILILIILIILIIILIIILIIII", universe = sfc_universe(SFC_RULES_HILBERT))
plot(p, grid = TRUE)
```


```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
p2 = sfc_hilbert(p, code = c(1, 1, 1, 1))
plot(p2)
```

WHen constructing a complex initial pattern sequence, $U$ can only be used to form $UU^{180}$,

$C$ is self-closed and cannot be connected, $B$, $D$, $P$ and $Q$ are half-closed and can
only be used as the start or end pattern of a sequence.

Note the initiali squence can only be consturcted by "straight", "lef" and "right". crossing is not allowed.


```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 1}
p = sfc_hilbert("IIIIIIIIII", code = "11111", rot = 90)
plot(p)
```


## Partial curve

For a curve xxx . Internally, they are only abstracted as a sequence with no requirement of being square.

```{r}
p = sfc_hilbert("R", "11111")
length(p)
plot(p[200:400])
```



## Flip and reverse

The design of the diagram is to let all forms of the curve can be expanded only by rotation, i.e. without leaving
the plate (flipping) or modify the sequence (reverse). However, we can define the flipping horizontal, vertical and
by the diagonal.

Flippping the base pattern can be easily obtained, here we only focused on a sequence of patterns. Observing the diagram,
in the expandiong step, only the three base pattersn of $I$, $L$ and $R$ are used. Thus in the following, we
only restructed the notation $X$ to the set $\{I, L, R\}$.

### Horizontal flip

We first calculate the horizontal flipping of a single base pattern:

$$ 
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(I^\alpha) &= I^\alpha, & \alpha \in \{0, 180\}, \\
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(I^\beta) &= I^{\beta + 180}, & \beta \in \{90, 270\}, \\
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(R^\alpha) &= L^\alpha, & \alpha \in \{0, 180\}, \\
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(R^\beta) &= L^{\beta + 180}, & \beta \in \{90, 270\}, \\
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(L^\alpha) &= R^\alpha, & \alpha \in \{0, 180\}, \\
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(L^\beta) &= R^{\beta + 180}, & \beta \in \{90, 270\}. \\
\end{align*}
$$

Then flipping a sequence of base patterns is a sequencing of individual flipping base patterns:

$$
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(X_1 X_2 ...) = \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(X_1)\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(X_2)...
$$


```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2}
draw_multiple_curves(
	p, sfc_hflip(p), 
	nrow = 1)
```


### Vertical flip

Vertical flipping can be constructed in the similar way as horizontal flipping, or it can be simply
constructed by first rotating the pattern $180^\circ$ then horizontal flipping:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(X^\theta) &= \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}((X^\theta)^{180}) \\
     &= \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(X^{\theta+180})
\end{align*}
$$

Rotation and horizontal flip can be swtiched:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(X^\theta) &= (\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(X^\theta))^{180}
\end{align*}
$$

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 2}
draw_multiple_curves(
	p, sfc_vflip(p), sfc_rotate(p, 180), sfc_rotate(sfc_hflip(p), 180), 
    nrow = 1)
```

it is easy to seee

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(X)) &= \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(X)) = X \\
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(X)) &= \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(X)) = X^{180}
\end{align*}
$$

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2}
draw_multiple_curves(
	p, sfc_hflip(sfc_hflip(p)), sfc_vflip(sfc_vflip(p)), 
	nrow = 1)
draw_multiple_curves(
	sfc_rotate(p, 180), sfc_vflip(sfc_hflip(p)), sfc_hflip(sfc_vflip(p)), 
	nrow = 1)
```

Vertical flipping can also be expanded to individual base patterns:

$$
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(X_1 X_2 ...) = \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(X_1)\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(X_2)...
$$

### Diagonal flipping

There are two types of diagonal flippig: against the diagonal with slop of 1 (bottomleft - topright) and -1 (topleft - bottomright).

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^1(X^\theta) &= \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(X^{\theta - 90}) = \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(X^{\theta + 90}) \\
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^{-1}(X^\theta) &= \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(X^{\theta + 90}) = \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{v}(X^{\theta - 90})
\end{align*}
$$

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 2}
draw_multiple_curves(
	p, 
    sfc_dflip(p, 1), 
    sfc_hflip(sfc_rotate(p, -90)), 
    sfc_vflip(sfc_rotate(p, 90)),
    nrow = 1
)
draw_multiple_curves(
	p, 
    sfc_dflip(p, -1), 
    sfc_hflip(sfc_rotate(p, 90)), 
    sfc_vflip(sfc_rotate(p, -90)),
    nrow = 1
)
```

Also

$$
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^1(\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^{1}(X)) = \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^{-1}(\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^{-1}(X)) = X
$$

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2}
draw_multiple_curves(
	p, 
    sfc_dflip(sfc_dflip(p, 1), 1), 
    sfc_dflip(sfc_dflip(p, -1), -1)
)
```

and 

$$
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^{-1}(\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^{1}(X)) = \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^{1}(\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^{-1}(X)) = X^{180}
$$

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2}
draw_multiple_curves(
	sfc_rotate(p, 180), 
    sfc_dflip(sfc_dflip(p, 1), -1), 
    sfc_dflip(sfc_dflip(p, -1), 1)
)
```

Diagonal flipping can also be expanded to individual base patterns:
$$
\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}(X_1 X_2 ...) = \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}(X_1)\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}(X_2)...
$$

### Reverse

Globally, the complete sequence is reversed, also individual patterns are also adjusted.

$$
\mathrm{Rev}(X_1 X_2 ... X_n) = (X'_n ... X'_2 X'_1)
$$

where 

$$
X'_i = \left\{\begin{matrix}
I^{\theta_i + 180} & \text{if } X_i = I^{\theta_i},\\ 
L^{\theta_i - 90} & \text{if } X_i = R^{\theta_i},\\ 
R^{\theta_i + 90} & \text{if } X_i = L^{\theta_i}.\\ 
\end{matrix}\right. i \in \{1, ..., n\}
$$

If flipping and reverse are also supported, the patterns at level = 1 can be represented by each other, e.g.

$$
\begin{align*}
I^{(1)}_2 &= \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(I^{(1)}_1) \\
L^{(1)}_2 &= \mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{h}(R^{(1)}_1) \\
L^{(1)}_1 &= \mathrm{Rev}((R^{(1)}_1)^{90}) \\
R^{(1)}_2 &= \mathrm{Rev}(\mathrm{Flip}_\mathrm{d}^{-1}(R^{(1)}_1))
\end{align*}
$$

As you can see, flippping and reversing increase the complexity of interpretation, thus we considered both flip and xxx 
and only allows rotation when expanding the curve.


## Visualize curves in other layouts


We can make e.g. circular transformation of the original coordinates

```{r}
p = sfc_hilbert("IIIIIIIIII", "11111", rot = 90)
loc = sfc_segments(p)
head(loc)
```

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
n = nrow(loc)
library(circlize)
circos.par(gap.degree = 0, cell.padding = c(0, 0))
circos.initialize(sectors = "foo", xlim = range(loc[, 1]))
col_fun = colorRamp2(seq(1, n, length = 11), RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, "Spectral"))
circos.track(ylim = range(loc[, 2]), panel.fun = function(x, y) {
    circos.segments(loc[1:(n-1), 1], loc[1:(n-1), 2], loc[2:n, 1], loc[2:n, 2], col = col_fun(1:(n-1)), lwd = 2)
}, track.height = 0.5, bg.border = NA)
circos.clear()
```

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
p = sfc_hilbert(strrep("I", 30), "11111", rot = 90)
loc = sfc_segments(p)
n = nrow(loc)
col_fun = colorRamp2(seq(1, n, length = 11), RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, "Spectral"))

library(spiralize)

spiral_initialize(xlim = range(loc[, 1]), start = 360, end = 360*3)
spiral_track(ylim = range(loc[, 2]), height = 0.95, background = FALSE)
spiral_segments(loc[1:(n-1), 1], loc[1:(n-1), 2], loc[2:n, 1], loc[2:n, 2], gp = gpar(col = col_fun(1:(n-1)), lwd = 1))
```
